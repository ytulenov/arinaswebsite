Thrilled to share a major milestone in my professional journey—I have officially passed the CFA Level I exam!

The past six months have been both challenging and rewarding, with countless hours of studying (6–7 hours per day!) dedicated to mastering the rigorous curriculum. The CFA charter is known for its depth and intensity, and preparing for Level I pushed me to develop strong analytical skills, discipline, and a deeper understanding of finance and investment principles.

Throughout this journey, one area that stood out to me was Ethical and Professional Standards. In an industry where trust and integrity are paramount, the CFA program reinforced the importance of ethical decision-making, transparency, and accountability. Understanding these principles not only strengthened my analytical abilities but also deepened my appreciation for the responsibility that finance professionals hold.

This achievement has reinforced my confidence in financial analysis, equity valuation, fixed income, derivatives, alternative investments, portfolio management, and more. More importantly, it has strengthened my commitment to continuous learning and growth in the field.

With Level I now behind me, I’m excited to take on the next challenge—Level II! Looking forward to expanding my expertise and continuing this journey toward earning the CFA charter.
